## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🌐 **Internet is required** for all email features
- 🔄 After adding or clearing data, **restart the program** for changes to take effect
- 🔑 Never share your **App Password** publicly or commit it to version control
- 📂 `Data.py` is your local database — don't manually edit it unless you know what you're doing
